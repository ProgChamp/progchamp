# ProgChamp - Programmer == Champ!

## What is it?

ProgChamp is a cryptocurrency tailor-made for greater developer communities. It spreads appreciations toward open source developers through easy-to-use interfaces, including Github integration and CLI.

## Why are we doing this?

Software development is tough. We believe one of the best way to get better as a developer is to contribute in open source projects. However, sometimes comments in developer community can be harsh, and often times people shy away from it because of strong criticisms and lack of appreciations. ProgChamp provides token of appreciation which acts like a glue to further unites this community and evolve toward a brighter future together.

## Why now?

Cryptocurrency market has gone crazy last year. Still, most of the coins are just for show. There's really no coin which people actually use in daily life. Even harder to find is the coin that's actually **fun** to use. That's where ProgChamp shines. We are making the experience of tipping and incentivising open source projects much more lucrative, but in the way the people can enjoy.

Most cryptos that target developer community tend to do things in a very formalized way. They typically setup very fine structures for rewarding bug/pull-request bounties. ProgChamp will be much simpler to use and own. Tipping people will be as easy as hitting the LIKE buttons. As far as we know, nobody is trying to do what we're doing, and especially with the string passion for greater developer community as we do. That's why we are confident that we can make mass adoption happen to propel ProgChamp to be the go-to token of appreciation in any community.

## Master Plan

We like to move fast. Here is the rough estimated timeline.

- Q1 2018 - Fund raising and formulate Airdrop to Github contributors
- Q2 2018 - Release MVP and testnet
- Q3 2018 - Release mainnet and partnership with top github projects
- Q4 2018 - Open a geek store, offering peripherals and accessories via ProgChamp

- Q1 2019 - Partnership with top companies in Silicon Valley and NYC to promote open source development through ProgChamp
- Q3 2019 - Promote the use of ProgChamp in large private development teams

- Q1 2020 - Spread the love to artist and musician communities, possibly after rebranding

## Why us?

For any project, team is the single most important factor that plays into making great products. We are real developers who have worked in some of the best companies in the industries -- Facebook, Quora, Hudson River Trading, to name a few. As this is our playing field, we are in the best positions to promote the use of ProgChamp ourselves.
